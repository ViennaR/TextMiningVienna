# Hillary Clinton E-mails

As described in the News, e.g. in a Washington Post [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/02/hacked-emails-indicate-that-hillary-clinton-used-a-domain-registered-the-day-of-her-senate-hearings) Hillary Clinton's E-mail server has been hacked and a selected set of E-mails have been released as part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hillary-clinton-emails).

The dataset has been cleaned and can be directly [downloaded](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hillary-clinton-emails/data) from Kaggle (registration may be required). The zip file contains the E-mail dataset in Sqlite and csv form. 

A few remarks after a quickly browsing through her E-mails:

- Hillary Clinton, like any cooporate user, does receive a lot of standardized E-mails with very little actual c 
- Funny: Very often she wrongly types 'pis print' instead of 'pls print' (please print).
- Interesting: Hillary Clinton seems to have the more interesting discussions via phone as indicated by a 'please call me', 'call back', etc. Would be interesting to check if those E-mails have something in common.
